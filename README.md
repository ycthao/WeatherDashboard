# WeatherDashboard #

As travelers, we want an outlook of the weather of mulitple cities we plan to travel to.  This application is designed to help travelers to get the current weather and the 5-day weather of the searched city.

## How it works ##

When Weather Dashboard is open,
I am given an input to search for a city.
Then I am presented with current and future condition for that searched city.
That city is also added to my search history.
When viewing current weather conditions for that city,
The city name, date, and icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index is displayed
When viewing UV index,
UV index is color coded to indicate if conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.
When vieweing future weather conditions for that city,
5-day forecast is daplayed showing date, icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, and humidity.
When clicked on city in search history,
Current and future conditions for that city is diplayed.
When Weather Dashboard is open,
last search city forecast is diplayed.
